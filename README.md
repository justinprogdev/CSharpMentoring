# CSharp Mentoring
## Welcome to Justin's C# Mentoring Repo!

Before we begin, let's install the necessary tools to start coding in C#.

1. **Visual Studio** & **.NET SDK**
2. **Verify .NET SDK**
3. **Git**

### 1. Installing Visual Studio and .NET SDK

As a developer, official documentation is your friend! Microsoft Learn is an *excellent* resource for learning about C# and .NET.

- C# is the programming language we will be using.
- .NET is the framework that compiles and runs your C# code.

Follow this guide to install **Visual Studio** (our Integrated Development Environment or IDE) and the **.NET 8 SDK**:  
[Install Visual Studio - Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows#install-with-visual-studio)

### 2. Verify the Installation

Once you've installed Visual Studio and .NET SDK, let's verify the installation:

- Open the **Command Prompt** by clicking the Windows start button and typing "CMD".
- In the Command Prompt, type the following command:

   ```bash
   dotnet --info
- You should see a version of 8, followed by some decimals

### 3. Install Git (Windows)

Git is a tool that helps you manage your code and track changes. Let's install it and set it up!

#### Download Git
- Open your browser and go to the official Git download page: [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
- The download should start automatically. If not, click the link for the latest version.

#### Install Git
- Once the download finishes, double-click the file to start the installation.
- The setup wizard will open. You can leave most options as the default and just keep clicking **Next** until the installation starts.
   - If you're unsure, here's what you can do:
     - When asked to select the default editor for Git, you can choose **Notepad** if you're not familiar with the other options.
     - For the "Adjusting your PATH environment" step, select the **recommended option**.
- Click **Finish** when it's done.

#### Verify Git Installation
1. Open the **Command Prompt**:
   - Click on the Windows Start button and type "CMD", then press Enter.
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command:
      ```bash
   git --version


# FINALLY, we're ready to code. 
Head over to the Project1 Folder and read the readme for project1!  
Happy coding friends!
